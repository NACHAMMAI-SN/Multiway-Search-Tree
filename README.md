 Welcome to the GitHub repository for  Multiway Search Tree project!

Description: 
This repository houses our implementation of a Multiway Search Tree, a versatile data structure designed to efficiently handle data with variable keys. Our approach allows each node to have multiple children, expanding its capacity compared to traditional binary search trees. The repository includes C header and source files (multiway_tree.h and multiway_functions.c) containing implementations of essential functions such as node creation, key insertion and deletion, and in-order traversal.

Key Features:

Efficient handling of variable key data
Easy-to-use functions for insertion, deletion, and traversal
Implemented in C for flexibility and portability
How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Include multiway_tree.h in your project.
Utilize the provided functions for seamless management of data.
